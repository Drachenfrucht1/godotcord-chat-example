# Godotord Chat example

This will be a step by step tutorial on how to implement some of the features Godotcord provides.
The main focus will be using the Godotcord Network peer and joining/searching lobbies.

Some basic knowledge about the Godot engine is required. I will **not** explain the basics of Godot, only features added by Godotcord.

The starting project with the needed scenes can be found in [prepared-scenes]().
